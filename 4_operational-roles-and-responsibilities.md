The process for an agency or state organization to join P20 WIN is defined in the “How to Become a Participating Agency” within this manual.

Each participating agency is responsible for the data that reside in their respective systems.  The Data Governance Policy does not affect data that is not shared through P20 WIN.  Rather, this policy covers only the data that is shared between organizations both at the unit and aggregate level through P20 WIN.  While data will be transported, matched and eventually stored electronically, this manual covers the use of shared data in reports and documents whether electronic or in print.
