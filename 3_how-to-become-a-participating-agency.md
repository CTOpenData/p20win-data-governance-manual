Any agency that is interested in joining P20 WIN must first submit a memo regarding their intent to join. This document should address the agencyâ€™s authority to access and share data and the potential security, privacy, confidentiality, or conflict of interest concerns that might be raised if the agency participates in the Data Sharing process.

Any agency interested in joining P20 WIN will go through the following process:

1. Submit a written request to the Executive Board from the chief executive of the interested agency or organization. The request should state why they want to join, what data 2. will be contributed to P20 WIN, their authority to access and share that data, security, confidentiality, and any conflicts of interest. 
3. The request is routed to the Data Governing Board for review. Their review focuses on the authority of the agency to access and share the data and identifies the potential for security or conflict of interest concerns.
4. If any confidentiality or privacy concerns are identified, the request is forwarded to the Operating Group for review.
5. If there are no questions and the Data Governing Board chooses to recommend adding the agency as a Participating Agency, their recommendation is sent to the Executive Board for a vote. 
6. The decision from the Executive Board must be a unanimous vote to accept the recommendation of the Data Governing Board and be considered a newly Participating Agency.
If approved, the applicant and all current Participating Agencies must sign the eMOU.

The official process to join can also be found in Appendix 1 of the Enterprise Memorandum of Understanding, which is included at the end of this document.
