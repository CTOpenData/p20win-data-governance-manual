## Key Processes

Together the P20 WIN data governing bodies work in concert to ensure that the following processes operate smoothly. 

| Process | Details |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Response to data requests | Requests for data from P20 WIN are directed from the Operating Group to the Data Governing Board, which manages the life cycle of the request. This process is outlined in the P20 WIN Data Request Management Procedure document. |
| Determination of authorized users and access rights to resultant datasets | In accordance with state and federal law and each data requestâ€™s Data Sharing Agreement, the Data Governing Board members representing agencies whose data are in a data request (i) approve the users who are to have access to de-identified unit record data from P20 WIN and (ii) establish the parameters for data dissemination and destruction for each specific data request. |
| Development and maintenance of cross-agency data dictionary | Data Stewards are responsible for ensuring that the data dictionary for each Participating Agency is complete and up-to-date. |
| Establishment of guidelines for data analysis as necessary | The Data Governing Board establishes processes that support a common approach to data analysis for resultant data sets as appropriate. |
| Expansion of P20 WIN | The Executive Board approves a process for adding new state agencies or organizations or additional data so that the technical infrastructure can be expanded and new agencies have representation in the named committees. The process for a new agency to join P20 WIN can be found later in this manual or in Appendix 1 of the eMOU. |
| Creation of policies to sustain P20 WIN | The Executive Board establishes policies to sustain and improve P20 WIN including how P20 WIN will be staffed and supported financially. |
| Modification to this policy | The Data Governing Board can make recommendations to modify P20 WIN policies and the eMOU to the Executive Board. |
